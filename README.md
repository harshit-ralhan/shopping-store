This is my first project using React and Redux. This is a frontend only project made with help of HTML, CSS, JS, React & Redux.

Note: There is an issue in CSS when the project is deployed on Vercel. Some of the CSS is simply not working, therefore the app ui looks a bit not rightly constructed.

Making this project took me about 4 days. In which nearly 1 or 1.5 days were taken for building the structure and functioning of the store and about 2-3 days for css designing.

This is why I now consider css-mind-modelling before development to be very important.
